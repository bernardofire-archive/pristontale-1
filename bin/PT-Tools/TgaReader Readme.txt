Hi! everyone.

1) Description:
TgaReader is a file design to you allow to patch and/or view tga files
from pristontale client.


2) Requeriments:
In order to use TGA reader/patcher you need have visual basic 6 runtime dll's.
and COMDLG32.ocx, you can find those files easily in microsoft or google for them.

Im not provide a full installer because i have not enough webspace.

3) Instalation:
Uncompress the zip file and place TgaReader.exe where u wish.

4) Usage:
Once you run the file choose open in order to view a file.
The program automatically will go to create a file called "ArchivoTmp.tga"
which will be a identical copy of your file that select but patched, and this
temporal file can be viewed by any TGA normal reader like paintshop pro.

So if u uncheck the option view file then you only will create the temporal file.
And if you check the option overwrite file then the temporal file will not be created
and the patch will be done over the fileitself.
