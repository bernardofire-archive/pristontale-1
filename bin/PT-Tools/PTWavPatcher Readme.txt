Priston Tale WAV Patcher Beta
by Obscura

Usage:

Put the program in a seperate folder (NOT PT FOLDER!).
Copy the WAVs from the PT Directory to the Patcher directory.
Run the patcher.

All files within the folder of the patcher will now be listenable in your music player.

WARNING!

Do not put the patcher in the PT folder, if you did do so PT wont work anymore and you would have to reinstall it.

I am in no way responsible for the improper use if this application!
